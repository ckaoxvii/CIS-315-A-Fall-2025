## Code Comments

Code comments are useful code that is not compiled by R, but it can convey important information about our code.

**Example 1.** Evaluate square-root of pi and write a code comment for the R code.

```{r}
sqrt(pi) # this evaluates square root of pi
```

## Scientific Notation In R

```{r}
1/1000000
```

The output of `1e-06` means $1 \times 10^{-6}$.

**Example 2.** Evaluate cosine of pi/2.

```{r}
cos(pi/2)
```

The output is `6.123e-17`, which is very close to 0 (as expected).

## Mathematical/Statistical Functions


**Example 3.** Evaluate e^2.
```{r}
exp(2) # e^2
```

**Example 4.** Evaluate log(10).

```{r}
log(10) 
```
